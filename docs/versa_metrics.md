| `snoop-ack-packets-success` | Successful snoop; All the fields are parsed successfully and send to other processes for subscriber update | 
| `snoop-relay-ip-missing-cnt` | IPv4 relay IP missing, it generally gets incremented for unicast acks, this alone does not lead to ignoring of packet |
| `snoop-opt-82-agent-info-missing` | self-explanatory |
| `snoop-opt-82-subopt-2-rmt-id-info-missing` | self-explanatory |
| `snoop-opt-32-subopt-51-lease-info-missing` | self-explanatory |
| `dhcp6-snoop-ack-packets` | DHCPv6 snoop ack packets received |
| `dhcp6-snoop-ack-packets-success` | Successful v6 snoop. i.e. all the fields are parsed successfully and send to other processes for subscriber update |
| `dhcp6-snoop-relay-ip-missing-cnt` | IPv6 relay IP missing |

| `dhcp6-snoop-error-detecting-device-type` | Need more information [Kuldeep: In case of dhcpv6, for cm and mta, the inner vendor specific |information would be present, if it is present, then boot file option also should be present, if boot file option 33 is missing this is incremented and packet will be ignored. In case of CPE, the inner vendor specific option wonâ€™t be present, and that is how we consider that as CPE device type |
| `snoop-renew-ack-packets` | self-explanatory |
| `snoop-device-mac-missing` | Device MAC field has invalid MAC address or NULL. From the trial sample lab packets, we found that this will be NULL string in case of Ack response for Lease Active Query, this will lead to dhcp packet ignore |
| `dhcp6-snoop-device-mac-missing` | Device MAC field has invalid MAC address or NULL, thus will lead to dhcp packet ignore |
